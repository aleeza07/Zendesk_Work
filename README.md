# Zendesk_Work
Dove into Zendesk, exploring its features and functionality within our company's setup Roco Private Limited.

I created eight mock tickets simulating real-world scenarios, including password resets 🔑, connectivity issues 🌐 , Outlook problems 📧 , account disruptions ⚠️, and software compatibility concerns 💻. Responding to these tickets as a customer support agent, I provided timely and effective resolutions, honing my skills in addressing customer queries 🛠️.

Working with Zendesk was an enjoyable experience, and I gained valuable insights into its ticketing system 🎯. I'm now confident in my ability to navigate this CRM tool as a customer associate. Its intuitive interface and user-friendly design make it an efficient platform for managing customer support requests ✨.
